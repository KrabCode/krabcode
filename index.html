<h2>You are not in control</h2>
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>You cannot help but read. You look at text and something in your brain reads it for you. Once you learn how to read you cannot skip the understanding of its meaning. 
</p>

<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>
When faced with a choice something in your brain suggests options and something else in your brain chooses. You tell yourself stories about why this option was the best.
</p>

<h3>Consciousness</h3>
<p>Your consciousness is a ray of attention colored by the emotional soup it swims in. Your attention points itself at interesting things. You have no say in what is interesting.
</p>

<h3>Needs</h3>
<p>
Your emotional state is a reflection of how well your needs are being met. Everyone has the same needs as everyone else.
</p>


<h3>Identity</h3>
<p>You need to feel special. Your immediate lived experience feels meaningful. The things you remember doing are a clear sign that you exist.
</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>You watch as your body goes through the motions. You are not there.</p>
